//Syntax and Conventions is basically the language that is used to compute actions.
//for example 1 we use a ; at the end of functions to convey a stop or in english a "."
//for example 2 we use "quotation marks" to start a string a of letters to form sentences.
//for example 3 we use the covention "print" to tell the computing system to show type on screen.
// Example 4 we use curly braces to begin and end code. Since lines of code can be written within each other, indentation is strongly suggested for mapping purposes.
// Last example is the forward slashes (2) for comments. These comments will be ignore by computing systems so you can type whatever you need to.
